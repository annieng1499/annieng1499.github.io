## Ingredients:

- 300 gram banana
- 160 gram sugar
- 120 ml cooking oil
- 120 ml skim milk
- An egg (60 – 65 gram)
- 200 gram all-purpose flour 
- 5 gram baking soda 
- 2 gram salt
- 100 gram chocolate chip

## Instructions:

### Step 1

Turn on the oven at 175 degrees if using a light-colored mold (165 degrees with a dark mold). Allow the oven to heat on 2 fire mode for 10-15 minutes.
Place baking paper into the loaf or sweep a thin layer of butter over the bottom of the mold and sprinkling a thin layer of flour on top. Turn the mold upside down to make the excess flour fall out.

<b>Note</b> I use 2 loaf size 16 x 8 x 6 cm (length x width x height), you can replace it with a round or square mold of equivalent volume.

### Step 2

Peel the bananas and smooth it with fork in a large bowl.

### Step 3

Add those ingredients: sugar, cooking oil, milk and eggs, then mix well. We have a mixture of wet ingredients.

### Step 4

In another large bowl, sift and mix flour, baking soda and salt together. We have a dry mix of ingredients.

### Step 5

Pour dry ingredients from <b> step (4) </b> into wet ingredients in <b>step (3)</b>. Using a whisk, mix until smooth.

### Step 6

Pour about 3/4 of the amount of chocolate chip into the mixture. Keep some to sprinkle on the cake surface. Chocolate chip is an optional material. If you do not eat a lot of sweet, you should reduce the sugar in the recipe if you use chocolate. You can use dried fruits or nuts instead of chocolate chips.

### Step 7

Pour the mixture to about 3/4 mold.

### Step 8

Bake at 175 degrees (165 degrees with dark mold) for about 50 - 60 minutes until the cake's surface turns brown, pressing on the cake surface, it immediately bounces back. Skew a toothpick into the middle of the cake, draw it and see if the toothpick is dry. Remove the cake from the oven and turn it upside down so it will cool completely on the rack. Cake should be in a quite dark color.
